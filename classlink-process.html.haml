            Market Research
          %div.section-text
            We were required to do extensive market research for the course to verify business insight 
            early one and at each stage. Our market research focused on large sample sizes and on what 
            people say and will buy, giving us board insight. We surveyed over 200 people and 80% of college 
            students said they would try out an app that instantaneously matched you with someone to eat with. 
            78% of working professionals under 30 said they would try it out. Our market research also 
            indicated that those 30+ would not use this app. With the target market of college students 
            and young professionals identified, we focused on creating an experience tailored to their 
            lifestyles and needs.

            User Research 
          %div.section-text
            While market research tells us what people will buy, validating our product, it is 
            less helpful in terms of product development. This is where my user research experience came in. User 
            research allowed us to understand what people do, how people use a product, and focused on smaller 
            sample sizes but resulted in deep focused insight. Each person on the team sat down with 5 
            people within our target market and engaged in hour long interviews.

            Key Insights
          %div.section-text
            We took our findings from both our surveys and interviews and analyzed 
            trends and key insights of what people said and did.
          %div.section-text
            %ul 
              %li 
                Over 80% of the people we surveyed or interviewed considered eating 
                to be an inherently social activity. A majority of those people would 
                prefer to eat with someone, even a stranger, than alone most of the time. 
              %li
                Common reasons why people eat alone are they don’t know other 
                people’s availabilities and their own, it’s inconvenient and time-intensive 
                to individually message people to ask if they want to eat, and it’s awkward 
                to ask strangers. 
              %li
                Most college students and some young professionals have inconsistent 
                meal times, especially lunch. For students, this is due to varying class 
                schedules and for young professionals, due to often finishing a given task 
                before eating lunch.
              %li
                A lot of people only had approximately an hour break for lunch 
                and thus finding someone to eat with was time-sensitive.
              %li
                For young professionals, most co-workers are older and have families 
                but want to meet people their age in the workforce.
              %li 
                Many college students and young professionals alike are busy and constantly
                bombarded with a myriad of apps and social media networks so they need
                something that doesn’t add to the “noise” of technology is not intrusive
                on their daily lives.

            Low-Fidelity Mockups
          %div.section-text
            This version emphasizes that Yumi matches you with someone to eat with by location
            However, when we showed users this app, some said it was confusing with a lot of
            information on the screen and that it also resembled the Uber app. Some users
            wondered why the map was necessary because they didn't needed to confirm an extact 
            location. It was just taking up space. Max distance is also something that users wouldn't
            change each time they used Yumi so in later iterations, it is placed in the "Settings".
