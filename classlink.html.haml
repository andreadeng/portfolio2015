            Main Element: Sign in Form
          %div.section-text
            Balancing the central focus of the page (sign in form) with background illustration that gives meaning to what 
            signing in allows you to access.

            Line-art Illustration
          %div.section-text
            I choose to create the illustration with line art to give it a friendly and not flashy look. I wanted to avoid a clipart-esque look for this education
            website as a lot of education websites often resort to clipart that doesn't add visual
            value. I did not color in my illustration so that it would not be distracting for this page.

            Organized Footer
          %div.section-text
            Their existing footer was messily organized with the logo seemly slapped on. I designed a dark gray footer that 
            provides a nice contrast to the illustration without distracting from it. The Classlink logo is 
            visibly and balancely placed on the left while basic links to other pages on the website are in the middle section of the footer.
            Social media links are placed on the right side. This way, information is grouped and easy to scan and find.

            Lessons Learned 
          %div.section-text
            I learned about line art! Before this, I had only created flat illustrations focusing
            on a limited color palette and long shadows. It was fun and challenging to depict 
            recognization elements with just lines and forced me to visual how a school or neighborhood
            looked like from another perspective.
          %div.section-text
            It was also different designing one web page rather than designing an entire website. Design one web
            page allowed me to really focus on just that page. It put myself into the user's shoes 
            to figure out how a user would get to that page and leave
            that page. I was forced to create a comprehensive experience for a single page, a skill I will use
            to break down designing entire websites.
