            SKRT is a critical design piece that fosters discussion about personal space, what it means for different cultures
            and individuals and its definition as a physical or virtual space. This was a team class project in Critical Making at UC Berkeley (link ot class page) created in collaboration
            with Andrew Fang, Brian C Ly, Sumer Mohammed, and Tessira Crawford. My main role was designing and building
            the overall skirt structure and individual pieces.

            Problem
          </div>
          <div class='section-text'>
            People just don't talk about personal space. It is an invisible yet ubiquitous force that we understand
            as we observe a culture over time. For example, every time I take BART (Bay Area subway), I notice people
            filling in every other seat, avoiding sitting right next to a stranger unless the subway is crowded.
            In California, even sitting right next to someone you don't know seems like a violation of personal
            space when the BART is not crowded.
          </div>
          <div class='section-text'>
            The personal bubble concept is also attacked and exaggerated by different social expectations.
            For example, feminists argue that women are constantly interrupted by a man’s physical
            presence through the spreading of their legs ("manspreading"). This physical sign of
            dominance, whether intentional or not, forces the woman into a smaller space.
            Others add that personal space is decreasing outwardly but increasing inwardly. Personal space exists
            internally because of the smartphone. These devices force users to not be aware of their
            context and only focus on matters occurring privately within the palm of their hands.

            The final prototype consists of a belt and five leaves
            made of up of acryllic pieces. I designed each piece in Illustrator, laser cut them, and then sanded them
            for a frosted look that half shows and half hides the structure and electronics of SKRT.
            I then heated each piece to bend them into the shape you see in the photos. My team and I
            strung these pieces, along with
            spacers, LED lights, fishing line, the electronics and wiring to create the final prototype.

          <div class='section-text'>
            Our intention is to neither attack nor exaggerate the personal bubble. Instead, we created a physical
            bubble that will not only define the wearer’s boundaries but also intrude into others’.
            Thus, we decided to create a skirt composed of 5 “leaves” that curl outwards towards any sign of movement,
            Using motors, sensors, carbon fiber, and lights, we created something that critiqued the personal bubble.
            We did not design this object to resolve an issue or to perpetuate one but to merely exist. And in its
            existence encourages people to talk about it and personal space.

            Lessons Learned
          </div>
          <div class='section-text'>
            I learned a lot about digital prototyping through SKRT as well as the Critical Making class.
            I had no experience with circuitry, laser cutting, 3D modeling before the class but through
            these projects gained valuable hands-on experience with these tools. Applying the
            design process to a relatively new realm of digital-physical products such as the wearable, SKRT,
            gave me new perspectives through both the medium and team I worked with. This project enabled me
            to really think outside of the box, to think beyond what "wearables" meant, to be creative, to collaborate,
            and to tell a story with something physical and moving, a skirt that seemed almost alive. I worked through the design process and building of a product in depth, from ideation to more than five
            iterations, to a high fidelity
            prototype.
          </div>
          <div class='section-text'>
            SKRT gives me a fresh view at purely digital interfaces like the smartphone apps and websites I
            often design. Thank you to my amazing team. We started off rocky coming from
            very different backgrounds of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Business, Architecture, and myself,
            Cognitive Science, but we learned to balance technical aspects and human factors.
            Special thanks to my instructor Eric Paulos and lab manager Chris Myers for opening my eyes to technologies
            I am beginning to imagine.
