            Problem
          </div>
          <div class='section-text'>
            Obstacles to buying healthy foods include insufficient nutrition
            knowledge, higher price of healthy foods, and unhealthy eating habits
            propagated by the media. Picknic simplifies the process of identifying
            healthy foods by assigning single-number nutrition scores to grocery
            items. Picknic helps users build long-term healthy habits through a
            points reward system that allows users to earn tangible prizes, coupons,
            and raffle tickets by buying healthy groceries. In addition, Picknic
            utilizes social encouragement and gamification to foster sustainability
            in healthy grocery purchases. Thus, Picknic re-brands healthy eating as
            financially desirable. For its corporate clients, Picknic’s user-specific
            newsfeed provides a tailored and effective advertising platform and its
            customer data provides valuable insight in product improvement. Through a
            forward-moving and multidimensional approach, Picknic creates an impact in
            targeting the obesity epidemic.

          <div class='section-text'>
            This support for a solution resonates with the results of our
            preliminary survey of college students, in which 89% of respondents
            stated price as the factor preventing them from purchasing healthy
            foods and 80% of respondents said that they would increase their
            purchases at Trader Joes (R), a potential paying customer, if
            discounts were offered. In addition, we have established contact
            with Culination (R) Culinary Director Chef MikeC a prospective
            partner who has also agreed to introduce us to John Mackey, the
            CEO of WholeFoods.

            Gamification and Easy to Use

            Our mobile application, Picknic, incentivizes people to buy healthier
            groceries through a simple, fun, and engaging platform. Users simply
            snap a picture of their grocery receipt and a list of purchased items
            populates the Picknic app. From there, points are awarded to each item
            based on its nutrition ranking. Foods are rated based on a comprehensive
            algorithm developed by our partner, Nuval, that takes into account
            ingredients, calories, fat content, macronutrients, and micronutrients.
            The healthier the food item, the more points are awarded. Users can
            use the points earned by buying healthy groceries to redeem real, tangible
            prizes such as free smoothies or a free week of salsa classes.
          </div>
          <div class='section-text'>
            Additional
            incentives to buy healthy come from the social and gamification aspects of
            the application. Users are connected to their network of Facebook friends
            who have Picknic, and a leaderboard featuring friends with the most points
            offers friendly competition. In addition, friends can create “Group Goals”
            where each member contributes part of the total points needed for a prize,
            such as a four-person ski trip. In addition, users can also access their
            personal NewsFeed which features content such as “Daily Deals” from
            grocery partners, Healthy Tips, and insights into friend activity.
            Furthermore, users can search for product nutrition scores on the mobile
            application as well as on the Picknic website. Appealing to both to the
            intrinsic and extrinsic needs of customers, Picknic gamifies buying healthy
            food and rebrands it as a fun, social, and sustainable choice.

            Lessons Learned

            I learned a ton about communication with potential users, customers, and business
            partners. Picknic was the project that began my design journey. I designed Picknic
            without putting a name to what I was doing. I thought I was just trying to solve a problem,
            only later realizing I was using elements of the design process without formalizing
            that knowledge. In fact the first time I heard design, specifically
            human centered design at an IDEO workshop at the 2013 Global Health and Innovation
            Conference at Yale University. After that, I decided to look into design more and
            look at what classes and clubs UC Berkeley had regarding this area. After challenges
            in contacting anyone, I was sitting in the last Berkeley Innovation meeting that Spring
            semester my Freshman year. The following year I would join Berkeley Innovation,
            the human centered design club at Berkeley, discontinue my work with Picknic and delve into
            design.
