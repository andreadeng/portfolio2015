            Obstacles to buying healthy foods include insufficient nutrition
            knowledge, higher price of healthy foods, and unhealthy eating habits
            propagated by the media. Picknic simplifies the process of identifying
            healthy foods by assigning single-number nutrition scores to grocery
            items. Picknic helps users build long-term healthy habits through a
            points reward system that allows users to earn tangible prizes, coupons,
            and raffle tickets by buying healthy groceries. In addition, Picknic
            utilizes social encouragement and gamification to foster sustainability
            in healthy grocery purchases. Thus, Picknic re-brands healthy eating as
            financially desirable. For its corporate clients, Picknicâ€™s user-specific
            newsfeed provides a tailored and effective advertising platform and its
            customer data provides valuable insight in product improvement. Through a
            forward-moving and multidimensional approach, Picknic creates an impact in
            targeting the obesity epidemic.

            This support for a solution resonates with the results of our
            preliminary survey of college students, in which 89% of respondents
            stated price as the factor preventing them from purchasing healthy
            foods and 80% of respondents said that they would increase their
            purchases at Trader Joes (R), a potential paying customer, if
            discounts were offered. In addition, we have established contact
            with Culination (R) Culinary Director Chef MikeC a prospective
            partner who has also agreed to introduce us to John Mackey, the
            CEO of WholeFoods.
