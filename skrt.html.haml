              %div.section-text.work-overview.black-text
                SKRT is a physical representation of one’s personal bubble. It is a critical design piece to foster conversation around personal space - what it means to different individuals and its definition as a physical or virtual space. Sensors on the wearable will detect when someone is too close to the wearer and trigger SKRT to expand, a concept of protecting the wearer’s personal bubble.

              Personal space is an invisible yet ubiquitous force that we understand as we observe a culture over time. For example, every time I take BART (the Bay Area subway), I notice that people avoid sitting next to a stranger unless the subway is crowded. In California, sitting right next to a stranger seems like a violation of personal space. 
            %div.section-text
              The personal bubble concept is also attacked and exaggerated by different social expectations. For example, feminists argue that women are constantly interrupted by a man’s physical presence through the spreading of their legs ("manspreading"). This physical sign of dominance, whether intentional or not, forces the woman into a smaller space. Others add that personal space is decreasing outwardly but increasing inwardly. Personal space exists internally because of the smartphone. These devices force users to not be aware of their context and only focus on matters occurring privately within the palm of their hands.

            %div.section-text
              Our intention was to neither attack nor exaggerate the personal bubble. Instead, we created a physical 
              bubble that not only defined the wearer’s boundaries but also intruded into others’. In doing so, we fostered conversations around physical space.
              People discussed issues from cultural sensitivities to those of sexual harassment. Watch our product video below!

              Modular Structure
            %div.section-text
              SKRT is made up of a belt and leaves consisting of laser cut acrylic pieces strung together by carbon fiber and fishing wire. This makes it really easy and inexpensive to add or remove pieces for customized fit and repair.

              Automated Feedback
            %div.section-text
              Sonar sensors detect when someone is within the wearer's personal bubble and instantly trigger motors on the belt to rotate and pull the fishing line attached to each leaf. This is what enables each leaf to curl up and SKRT to “expand” in response to an intrusion of personal space.

              Sensory Engagement
            %div.section-text
              When SKRT expands, it pushes people away but also draws them closer. This is due to SKRT’s intriguing and highly sensory response. Lights interweaved in SKRT flicker in sync with the leaves movements which also create an ethereal rattling sound.

              Elegant Finish
            %div.section-text
              Each acrylic piece is precisely laser cut and bent to line up cleanly when strung and overlayed. Each piece is carefully frosted to allow the electronics to peak through without being distracting. It is a simple touch that transforms the personality of the wearable from something very “tech” to one that is more fashionable and human. The frost finish in addition to the choice of small, round lights contributes to a delicate and elegant feel.
