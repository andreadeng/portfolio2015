          Unpack the problem.
        %div.section-text
          When I first start a project, I talk to a lot of people to make sure I am solving the right problem rather than building off of assumptions. I ask a variety of questions, observe their frustrations and attitudes to help me create systems diagrams and personas. This in turn helps me define a goal for my project and fill in the key question “How might we  ________ ?”
        
        %div.section-title
          Sketch out ideas.
        %div.section-text
          This is where I take insights from my research, interviews, and observations and diverge into infinite possible solutions to the problem. I love brainstorming in a group and building off of each other’s crazy or plain ideas.
        
        %div.section-title
          Delve into solutions.
        %div.section-text
          After putting all the ideas out there and grouping them, I choose several directions to explore. I plug in personas, storyboard, and do more sketching to discover how emotions and behavior play a role.

        %div.section-title
          Prototype and test.
        %div.section-text
          I like to start with quick and dirty paper or Illustrator mockups early on and observe people interacting with them and asking questions. When I’ve worked through initial kinks and overall structure of the solution, I create a higher fidelity, clickable prototype through Marvel and observe users complete a series of common tasks and leave comments. Throughout this process, I subtract features that are obvious and unnecessary and add those that are meaningful, working towards an elegant solution. I also aim to weave in more emotions in the product to not just have usability but also delight.

        %div.section-title
          Interact with Dev.
        %div.section-text
          When designing a product, it is important for me to check in with development and hear their perspectives on the feasibility or my solution or thoughts on other technology I had not considered. This keeps me in check with designing something that can be developed and then put into the hands of users for further proof of concept.

        %div.section-title
          Iterate the process.
        %div.section-text.last-row
          Design is a very iterate process and it is important to not just follow a step by step process to magically get to a solution. Instead, I need to repeat various parts of this process in order to address challenges and new questions that arrive in order to make improvements to the solution.
